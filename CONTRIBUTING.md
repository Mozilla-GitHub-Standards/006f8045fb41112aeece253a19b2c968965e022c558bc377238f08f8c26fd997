# Contributing to Chatspaces

## Current status - December 10th, 2013

This project is in a prototype stage. As such it's under heavily development and undergoing
radical changes on an almost millisecondly basis. Because of that, we have a small elite team
of top people who are furiously throwing things around to figure out how the bits should
play out and what sorts of bits are required.

Because of this quantum flux like state, this is a lousy project for contributors who
are not in the core team to help out on. We encourage you to help by watching for now. If
this piques your interest then when things slow down, we'll have a better core to help
out on.

Thank you for understanding.
